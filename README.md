> Solving the climate crisis, one swipe at a time 🌍🔥

A community-driven game where players explore, create and share scenarios for a sustainable future.

## Welcome, Mrs. President! 🖖

Solving the climate crisis will need everyone to contribute in one way or another. But that is extremely hard given that different "solutions" affect people in different ways. And you need broad public support to succeed 🧩

After 30 years of global stalemate, we've realized there is no such thing as a perfect solution. Instead, we need to find acceptable compromises to make any progress at all.

But choosing acceptable compromises in a complex equation with ever-changing variables is a challenge to say the least. Especially if you don't take your time to see the bigger picture and understand how everything is connected 🕸

## And that brings us to why you are here...

No previous leaders have yet managed to solve the climate crisis. People were starting to lose hope. But then, a new kind of leader emerged. A leader who could see the bigger picture. A leader who finally found a way to balance "acceptable losses" with the grand vision of a sustainable future.

You 🙋‍

And that's why you were elected, Mrs. President. People are literally betting their lives on your decision-making skills.

You have 8 years.

So, will you guide your society to a safe, just future? Or will you let the world burn, just like so many have done before you? 🌍🔥

Seriously though, no pressure. You got this (we hope...) 😬
